I am a highly adaptable developer with more than twelve years of experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining 
Client/Server applications. I worked heavily with relational databases on large systems. I prefer to code in.Net/C# & *SQL
programming languages, but I am willing to learn anything new.

I have started my career in 2009 with Accenture as a junior programmer in Oracle capability. I worked there mainly on 
projects in telecommunication industry with teams that span the life cycle of software to identify business needs and 
solution options. I gathered extensive experience in coding and testing various database applications. 
In July 2012, I joined Deloitte and started to work primarily on U.S. cross-border tax investigation projects for financial 
services in Zurich (Switzerland), to where I later relocated. My role as a technical lead provided me a possibility to improve 
my developing and debugging skills in applications build on .Net technologies. Consequently, I became a team leader of 
approximately 5 people which comprise project timelines, and removal of project roadblocks. 
In 2017 I joined Oriflame Software where I took the opportunity to work in data team and participated on migration to new 
technologies
